**Topic**  

Investigating Gnosticism elements in Hermann Hesse‘s creation
 
**Topic Context**  

This research assumes that German writer Hermann Hesse draws on some elements of Gnosticism and expresses them in his own way in many of his works. This is the topic of my BA thesis. In my BA thesis, I examine four writings of Hesse,  Beneath the Wheel, Inside and Outside, Demian, and The Glass Bead Game, trying to interpret how Hesse displays Gnosticism in his creation. I came up with this hypothesis because when I read Hesse’s works, I found there are important symbols of Gnostic theories, for example, “alien”, “the God”, and “outside and inside”, occurring in various writings of Hesse. The ways Hesse interprets these symbols in his novels and prose are also similar to some of the Gnostic concepts. 
As far as I am concerned, this phenomenon may be because of Hesse‘s close relationship with German romanticism, which interiorly matches the Gnostic attitude about the position of God and human beings in the world. Other than that, Hesse absorbed traditional Eastern philosophy concepts in his creation, which is one of the origins of Gnosticism theories.
There are a lot of limitations within my investigation in the thesis. For instance, I can only analyze four of Hesse’s works in this thesis due to the limitations of length and writing time of the thesis. The analysis in these four works is incomplete because I cannot search for every word related to Gnosticism existing in the text. My thesis was written in Chinese and the language of my research subjects is also Chinese, when Hesse wrote them in Germany. The translation of works will lead to loss and misunderstanding of information.
So, I would like to use digital methods and tools to test the hypothesis, breaking the barriers of language, the text quantity, and my own research ability.


**Research Question and Thoughts**  

How Gnosticism elements display in Hermann Hesse’s works


I would like to build a text corpus of Hermann Hesse‘s work and a corpus of Gnosticism Classical text at the first step. 
I will conduct word frequency research on the Gnosticism classical texts and search for the most frequent words as typical elements in Gnostic theories. Then there is a concordance analysis using these elements in Hesse‘s texts, through which every word occurring in each writing of Hesse will be listed.
I also would like to generalize the topic of Hesse’s work through topic modeling and then compare them to the theme of Gnosticism texts.
All the results will be represented through using visualization tools.
